CCC Admin Panel v 0.1
===

Author: Sanghyun Lee
Date: Sept. 12, 2014

This admin panel will be solely used by the organization I am currently involved in.

On completion, it will have following features (the list may be updated as being developed):

 - Log in/out 
 - Basic CRUD functions on Events
 - Basic CRUD functions on Members
 - Basic CRUD functions on Admins
 - Grant/deny features controlled by admin access levels
 
All will be written in PHP, with the most updated version of front-end framework Bootstrap (current version 3.2.0.)

Due to security reason, the php file consisting DB details will be stored locally on my computer and will never be attached to the package, but since I will be using definitions on PHP, it will be easily recognizable what field goes in where.

I will be updating the README as I go along.
